## Installation
### Download the Bundle
Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the following command to download the latest version of this bundle:

``` bash
$ composer require fourlabs/gamp-bundle
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) of the Composer documentation.

### Compatibility with Guzzle 5 and 6

If you are using PHP 5.5 or above and Guzzle 6 then:

    {
        "require": {
            "fourlabs/gamp-bundle": "^2.0"
        }
    }

Or if you are using PHP 5.4 or above and Guzzle 5 then:

    {
        "require": {
            "fourlabs/gamp-bundle": "^1.1"
        }
    }

### Enable the Bundle

Then, enable the bundle by adding the following line in the *app/AppKernel.php* file of your project:

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new FourLabs\GampBundle\FourLabsGampBundle(),
    );
}
```

## Usage

##### Example

``` php
$this->get('gamp.analytics')
    ->setTransactionId('7778922')
    ->setAffiliation('THE ICONIC')
    ->setRevenue(250.0)
    ->setTax(25.0)
    ->setShipping(15.0)
    ->setCouponCode('MY_COUPON')
    ->setProductActionToPurchase()
    ->setEventCategory('Checkout')
    ->setEventAction('Purchase')
    ->sendEvent()
;
```

Refer to [the library's documentation][2] for other remaining methods and examples, they all work. This library 100% supports all GAMP features.

> **Note:** You don't have to use the protocol version, tracking id, anonymize ip and async request (non-blocking) methods as they're automatically set in based on your config file.
